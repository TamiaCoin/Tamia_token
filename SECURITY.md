# Security Policy for $TAMIA Token

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in the **$TAMIA Token Smart Contract** or associated tools, please **do not create a public GitHub issue**. This ensures that potential vulnerabilities are not exposed before they are fixed.

Report security issues responsibly via email:

**security@tamia.club**

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Your environment (e.g., Solana version, Anchor version)
- Any potential impact

We treat all reports confidentially.

## Response Process

Once a report is received, we aim to:
1. Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
2. Assess the severity of the vulnerability.
3. Work with the reporter to verify the issue.
4. Release a fix in a timely manner, prioritizing critical security issues.

We may credit the reporter in the release notes or in the project documentation, with their consent.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes and assessments are prioritized for:
- The **latest stable release** of the $TAMIA smart contract
- Any active development branch that is publicly deployed

## Safe Usage Guidelines
